## Overview

This project is part of a challenge where our task was to replicate an Instagram-like frontend for a website, featuring only dogs. The goal was to assign classes to HTML elements using HTML and CSS to create an aesthetically pleasing and functional design that represented the site we were told to replicate.

## Challenge Details

- **Objective:** Replicate the Instagram frontend with a focus on showcasing adorable dogs.
- **Tools Used:** HTML and CSS.

## My Approach

Before diving into the existing code, I wanted to test my skills by attempting to replicate the page without referring to the original codebase. My only goal was to eyeball the original created site. This version you see here is my attempt at creating a visually appealing and dog-centric frontend that represents the given site.

## Key Features

- **Dog-Centric Design:** The layout emphasizes dogs, with a clean and user-friendly interface reminiscent of Instagram's style.
- **Responsive:** The design is crafted to be responsive, ensuring a seamless viewing experience on various devices.
- **HTML and CSS Only:** The challenge was completed using only HTML and CSS, showcasing my proficiency in front-end development.


## Conclusion

This challenge was a great opportunity to showcase my HTML and CSS skills in recreating a popular frontend design. It allowed me to demonstrate my ability to structure HTML, apply CSS styling, and create an engaging user interface.


**Note:** While this version is my independent attempt, I will now review the existing codebase to see how closely it aligns with my vision. By looking at the original codebase I aim to see how the original site was created and how the creator used flex-boxes, grids, classes, etc. This will allow me to understand the differences between the original and my version, allowing me to learn and improve my HTML, CSS skills..
